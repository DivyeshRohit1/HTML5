# CTEC 3905 - FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT

I have chose to make a website about Singers. 
The reason I chose to do this website is because it's something I have a passion for and also enjoy. 
I was considering doing something related to the course but I found it fun to create the website while talking about something else 
I am passionate about. 
I have created a homepage called index.html and created 4 other pages called BI.html, WeekEn.html, CB.html, Justin.html, Drake.html, rihanna.html, 
Contact.html, david.html and LatestSongs.html
I have also added images and I have created a CSS to make my website look good and there is also a script.js file.
