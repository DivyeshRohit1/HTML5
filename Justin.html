	<p>Justin Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981, he is an American singer-songwriter, actor and record producer. 
		Born and raised in Tennessee, he appeared on the television shows Star Search and The All-New Mickey Mouse Club as a child. 
		In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, 
		which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake began to adopt a more mature image as an artist 
		with the release of his debut solo album, the R&B-focused Justified (2002), which yielded the successful singles "Cry Me a River" 
		and "Rock Your Body", and earned his first two Grammy Awards.</p>
